# OpenGL Tech Demo

OpenGL demos showing off what i learned so far. 
I am using GLFW for window management and input, Assimp for model loading, 
SOIL for image loading and ImGui for the UI panel, everything else is written 
by me from scratch.

The resource repository which contains all the assets for the scenes is here: [Link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6gny4LvztHhTERUMUgtUFdZZEE "Resource repository")
